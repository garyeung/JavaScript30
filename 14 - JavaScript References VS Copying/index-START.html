    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let name = 'Gary';
    let age = 46;
    let male = true;

    console.log(`Name: ${name}, Ages: ${age}, Gender is Male: ${male}`);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const playersCopy = players;

    console.log(playersCopy, players);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    playersCopy[0] = 'Gary';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(playersCopy, players);
    players[0] = 'Wes';

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const playersCopy2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const playersCopy3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const playersCopy4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    playersCopy4[0] = "Wow";
    const playersCopy5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(playersCopy4, players);


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const p2 = person;
    p2.age = 3;
    console.log(p2, person);
    person.age = 80;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const p3 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 6, hobby: 'gardening'});
    console.log(p3, person);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const p4 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const p5 = Object.assign({}, person);
    const p6 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
